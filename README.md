# Emotion_Detector
Developed a deep learning-based emotion detection system using SVM for classification, where the  model processes input images of faces with different emotions and predicts the corresponding  emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.). This system aims to achieve accurate emotion classification  by combining feature extraction techniques .
